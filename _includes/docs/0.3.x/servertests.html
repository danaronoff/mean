        We use <a target="_blank" href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a> to test the server side logic. Mocha tests are asynchronous, easy to maintain, and uses a readable <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> syntax.
      </p>
      <h4>Assertions</h4>
      <p>
        Mocha needs an external assertion library to predicate the result of each test, in this case <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js">Should.js</a> is being used. Should is an expressive library aiming to simplify tests and be readable. It extends the Object.prototype with a single non-enumerable getter that allows you to express how that object should behave.
      </p>
      <h4>Test Files</h4>
      <p>
        Each entity have its own test file located inside the <b>app/tests</b> folder.
      </p>
      <h4>Writing Tests</h4>
      <p>
        There are a few common steps we use to test an entity:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the <b>beforeEach</b> or <b>before</b> functions take care of prerequisites and create the objects you are about to use in your tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each test start with a <b>describe</b> function to indicate which method is being tested.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, add your scenario tests using the <b>it</b> function.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the <b>it</b> function run the tests functionality and use should to assert what the end result should be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally use <b>after</b> or <b>afterEach</b> functions to finalize your tests and clear the test database.
        </li>
      </ol>
